Garments fectory Management System Database Design
The most important component of the system is the database design. It can be easily realized, if we consider 
the amount and the scale of the Garments fectory. To have a strong and flexible system, the design must be well 
studied. After some studies including investigation, workflow scenarios, traces and design, we obtain the 
following tables. Typically, an Garments fectory system has Ten basic elements: 
•	Product
•	Purchases
•	Order
•	Category
•	Stock
•	Customers
•	Order Details
•	Employee
•	Sales and
•	Supplier.
Each element must be tracked based on its own elements. Current Garments fectory, or products on hand, is updated 
by tracking incoming shipments and outgoing orders. Order alerts can be set to trigger when inventory levels 
fall below custom-defined minimum levels.
